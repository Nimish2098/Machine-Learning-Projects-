# Basic Models and Core Mechanisms
This repository contains fundamental machine learning models and their core mechanisms, implemented in simple and clear ways to help beginners understand the basics. Each model is accompanied by basic implementations and explanations to provide a hands-on learning experience.

Introduction
This repository aims to provide a collection of simple implementations of basic machine learning models. The focus is on the core algorithms and mechanisms behind each model, making it easier to grasp the fundamentals without unnecessary complexity.

Models Included
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  
Each model is explained with its basic working principles and implemented using Python libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, and pandas.
